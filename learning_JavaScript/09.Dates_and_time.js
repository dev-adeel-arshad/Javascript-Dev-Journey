let myDate = new Date();
console.log(myDate);// this will give the date in format that is somehow difficult lets change that onto strings

If we want to add date of our will we can do that as following:

*/

//let myTimeAndDate= new date(2000,4,20,10,45,19)//we ca put time and date both
console.log(myOwnDate);//this will not give the suitable format.
console.log(myOwnDate.toString());
console.log(myOwnDate.toDateString());//now we can see the date in a proper format
let mycreatedDate = new Date("01-20-2025");
console.log(Date.now());
console.log(mycreatedDate.getTime());

//It will print the minutes that were passed after hour like if the time is 3:05 it will give 5

let newDay = new Date()
console.log(newDay.getMinutes());
console.log(newDay.getMonth() + 1);//it will return the index value so we have to add 1 in it

// there is a benifit to use the locale strings as we can play with some values with the help of objects like here we want whole day name
console.log(newDay.toLocaleString('default', {
    weekday: "long",
}));
// By using the locale string we can change many other things of date and time
