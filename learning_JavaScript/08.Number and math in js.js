when we dynamically creat an neaw data type than it will be reffered as object for example

now the variable "balane" has different kind of prototypes as we have studeis about the strings

//+++++++++++++++++ MATH +++++++++++++
console.log(Math);// it will show that it consists of many prototypes.
console.log(Math.abs(-4));// Negative values will be converted into positive values
console.log(Math.round(4.56));//it will round of the value passsed
console.log(Math.ceil(4.2));//it will give 5 beacause if the given value is greater than whole number even difference is 0.01 it will add 1 in the given whole number for example if the given number was 4.1 the output will be 5.

//****imp concept*******
console.log(Math.random())//it will always show random value between 0 and 1

//if we have to write random number between 10 Nd 20 than
